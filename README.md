# Encguess

Encguess is an application which attempts to guess the encoding of a given file.
It will be focused on solving practical problems which I have encountered, so it
might be a bit too tailored to me, and not generic enough for general use.

## Requirement
* Go (v1.13+)
* GNU Make (optional)

## Compiling
Either run `make` or `go build .`

## Running

After compiling, the program can be run with ./engcuess FILENAME, where FILENAME
is the name of the file you want to know the encoding of.
